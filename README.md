# Datamining in C
## Project to Implement Generic Datamining Algorithms

Implement Datamining Algorithms described in [Guide to Data Mining] (http://guidetodatamining.com) and "Algorithms of the Intelligent Web" in C. 

# Example 
```c
  // Example for using Collaborative Filtering with Euclidean Distance

  // 1. Compile 
  gcc example2.c -o recommend -lm

  // 2. recommend (can use ratings.csv in sample datafiles)
  ./recommend <ratings.csv>
```
